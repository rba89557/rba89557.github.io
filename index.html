<Center> UGA Summary </Center>
</H2>
<font color ="red">The University of Georgia is located in Athens, Georgia. It was founded in 1785. UGA was the first American public Land-grant, state-chartered university. Abraham Baldwin, a Yale graduate, was the first president of UGA. One of the most famous attractions at UGA is the main entrance, above North Campus, where the cast-iron arches stand in between broad street and the beginning of the UGA campus. Rumor has it that if you pass through the arches before you graduate, you will not graduate on time.</font>

 Greek Life plays a major role in the lives of many students attending UGA. 23% of undergraduate students are members of Greek organizations, including 21% of men, and 24% of women. One of the most famous streets in Athens, Milledge Avenue, is lined with numerous Greek Revival and Victorian style mansions that house many members of Greek Life. Other houses can be found in Greek Park, or scattered around Athens. Greek organizations are known to contribute to numerous philanthropies and charitable causes. There are 18 sororities recognized by the Panhellinic Council, and 26 fraternities that make up the Interfraternity Council, or IFC.
